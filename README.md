# Django Resume

Django Resume is a Django app built to generate a resume on a user's site.

It includes fields for just about everything one could want on a basic public resume, including jobs with achievements, skillsets with skills (optionally linked to urls), microformats (hResume) support, and a pre-made basic template/ stylesheet with SASS-generated stylesheets.

Run it with:

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

OR

```bash
docker-compose up
```

# TODOs

* create setup.py for installation & verify installable version works
* additional admin features like linking skills to skillsets in inline edits.
* print stylesheet.
